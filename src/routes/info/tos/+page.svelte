<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Terms of Service</h1>

By purchasing an Ashlar device and registering it using our provisioning
software, you acknowledge that you are joining a playful, experimental web3
mining community with no guarantee of profit or fixed rules. Participation is at
your own risk and the network's rules may change at any time. We stand behind
the craftsmanship of the device with a like-for-like guarantee if you fail to
make a single successful claim. Beyond that, you assume all liability for
network penalties (for example, operating more than five devices) and for any
malicious acts you commit. Consistent with the ENTROPY network's founding
principle, there is no direct link between the entropy you generate and token
value; any value is determined solely by network participants. The ENTROPY
network is operated by a community of individual "miners"; its servers, rules,
and norms are not set by Just Entropy, Inc. This agreement is governed by the
laws of the State of Delaware.
